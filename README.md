# DePTH2-Analysis

## Overview
DePTH is a predictive model designed to assess the interaction between Human leukocyte antigens(HLA) and T-cell receptor(TCR). By inputting an HLA and a TCR, the model generates a score representing their association. For details on the model structure and usage, please refer to [https://liusi2019.github.io/DePTH-tutorial/](#).

## Features
This repository focuses on the further development and analysis of the DePTH model, including:
1. **Confounding Factors Analysis**  
   - Analysis of factors such as:
     - CDR3 length  
     - TCR generation probability  

2. **DePTH 2.0 Enhancements**  
   - Updates and improvements to the original DePTH model for better performance and usability.
