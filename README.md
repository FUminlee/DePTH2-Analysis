# DePTH2-Analysis

## Overview
DePTH is a predictive model designed to assess the interaction between HLA and TCR. By inputting an HLA and a TCR, the model generates a score representing their association. For details on the model structure and usage, please refer to [XXX](#).

## Features
This repository focuses on the further development and analysis of the DePTH model, including:
1. **Confounding Factors Analysis**  
   - Analysis of factors such as:
     - CDR3 length  
     - TCR generation probability  

2. **DePTH 2.0 Enhancements**  
   - Updates and improvements to the original DePTH model for better performance and usability.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python (version X.X or higher)
- Required packages (list packages, e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.)

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DePTH2-Analysis.git
